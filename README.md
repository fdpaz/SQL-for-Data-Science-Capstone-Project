# SQL-for-Data-Science-Capstone-Project
Now that you’ve completed your analysis, it’s time to tell the story.  In this milestone, we will look at different ways we can present your findings.  Many presentations to management are via presentation software such as MS Powerpoint / Apple KeyNote / Google Slides and are typically static: bullet points and clipped charts. 

Audience
Sometimes, however, you may want a more dynamic approach to tell the story.  It all boils down to understanding your audience and the goal of your presentation.  

“Who?”
Who are you presenting to?

Colleague? Team?

Your Manager/Supervisor?

Sr. Management?

Customer?

External audience?

“Why?”
Why do you want to present to this audience?

Sharing process and findings?

Status / Plans?

Seeking additional funding? Strategy Setting?

Insights for customers?

Education or case studies?

“What?”
What should you share?

What level of detail?

More text / More visualization?

Key points or nitty-gritty code snippets?

Bottom line info or high level trends?

Sensitive Data or publicly consumable?

  "How?"
It all depends on the above … 

Typically, the higher up the “ladder” you present, the less detail you are providing; this doesn’t mean that you won’t be asked detailed questions (that you’ll need to have answers for), but you typically will have less time to communicate.

For Status/Plans, Strategy, Funding, Education/Case Studies, these are typically good places to use presentation software to gather your results and place your data in a position to tell the story.

Start at the 10,000 foot level view and work your way down to what’s closest to the audience and end with your “ask” or your “key points”

Don’t fill your slides with text, just bullets to guide you

“A picture is worth a thousand words” … if you can create a graphic to tell the story (charts, infographics) then do it!

When sharing the process and findings or working directly with customers on insights -- these are good opportunities to use more dynamic techniques

Software like Jupyter notebooks combined with markdown, code, charts, and results allow you to be flexible and respond to what-if questions more easily. You’ll be in your working environment and can show not only what you did to get to your results, but the results themselves. If you need to try something, you can.

Software like Tableau allows you to build visualizations and storyboards connecting to differing data sources locally or remotely. This is great for quick exploratory analysis and putting together findings quickly as well.

 

Review criteria
menos 
Your presentation will be a culmination of the other milestones you completed in this project-based course. You will create your presentation using any media you choose and use the Rich Text Editor feature to submit your presentation. 

For presentation ideas:

Look at DataBricks and markdown (notebooks)

Visualizations … raw data Infographics

Presentation Styles / Audiences

Reference SQL output vs. visualizations

Your presentation must include:
Build on Project Proposal
Build on your project proposal (from Milestone 1) that described the client or dataset you chose, the approach you were going to take, your initial hypotheses, and your initial approach. Include descriptive stats and any visualizations from your data exploration. You want to highlight key learnings from your data exploration and any aha's or changes to your plan as a results of your findings:

Include Client/Hypotheses/Approach

Include artifacts from previous modules

Include results (good and bad paths); Correlations / regressions

Graphics / Visualizations

Discuss Insights Discovered
Discuss insights discovered (results from your diving deeper / going broader analysis). This is where you put your spin on what you’ve discovered

Discuss your hypotheses and any direct outcomes from whether you were right or wrong.  Did you change your hypotheses? Or create new ones?

Discuss any metrics you created and why?

Discuss discoveries about relationships in the data / themes discovered.
